# Neural Network and Deep Learning Assignments
Models Included:


* ** Perceptron: The simplest form of a neural network used for binary classification.

* **Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron): An improvement over the Perceptron that uses a linear activation function and minimizes a cost function (MSE) via gradient descent.

* **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron): A feedforward artificial neural network that uses backpropagation for training on non-linearly separable data.
